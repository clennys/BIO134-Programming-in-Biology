    "\n",
    "Rabbits have unlimited food supply. Thus, the rabbit population increases by 5% each day as the net result of birth and natural death. At the same time, the rabbit population is decreased by the presence of foxes. The decrease is proportional to the number of encounters between rabbits and foxes. The more foxes there are, the more rabbits are being caught and the more rabbits there are, the easier it is for foxes to catch the rabbits. Specifically, each day the rabbit population is reduced by 0.0002*(number of foxes)*(number of rabbits).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fox population decreases by 10% per day as the net result of birth and natural death independent of the number of rabbits. The presence of rabbits has a positive influence on the number of foxes. This depends on how many rabbits are being caught and this is again dependent on the number of foxes as well as the number of rabbits. The increase amounts to 0.0001*(number of foxes)*(number of rabbits) each day.\n",
