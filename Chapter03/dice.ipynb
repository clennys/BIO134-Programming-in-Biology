    "Python and other programming languages generate random numbers using a certain algorithm that produces a sequence with characteristics of actual random numbers. However, the sequence that the algorithm produces is not really random, since it is completely determined by its initial value, the seed. When you use a random function in your code, usually python just takes some seed, for example based on time, so that the random numbers are different every time you run the program. However, you can also define the seed yourself so that the random numbers will be the same every time you run the program. Using a seed can be useful, for example, for debugging. In this course we will use it because of the auto-checkers.\n"

    "This simulates the rolling of a dice 30 times. As you can see, a seed has been set, so that the program should generate the same random numbers every time. In this case, the last few random numbers should be 4,5,4,1,3,6,3,6,3. If you changed the seed from 141 to some other number, the program would generate another sequence of random numbers (and the autochecker would no longer work...)\n",
